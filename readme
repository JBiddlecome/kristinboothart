# Kristin Booth Art

Static, single-page gallery and shop preview for artist Kristin Booth. Open `index.html` in a browser to explore.

## Structure
- `index.html` – markup for hero, selected works, previews, bio, and contact sections.
- `styles.css` – dark, artsy styling with responsive layouts and product mockups.
- `script.js` – populates the gallery, handles artwork selection, and updates live previews for wall, tee, and mug surfaces.
- `Images/` – source artwork and portrait assets (including "Title Image.jpg" and "Hero Image 2.jpg").

## Previewing
No build step is required. Serve the folder locally (e.g., `python -m http.server`) or open `index.html` directly to interact with the selectors and previews.
